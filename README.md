Throughout this project, i created a password generator using my basic skills after briefly touching upon javascript for the first time. The acceptance critera required was to generate a password that 
required a minimum of 8 characters to a maximum of 128 characters. It also gave the options of using uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, and numerical values. This incorpated lots of javascript programming which
is a brand new programming language for me so it was challenging to decipher where to add the arrays and it statements. Some troubleshooting also made me realize the wrong placement of brackets, and refactoring completed the assignment and 
executed its proper functions.
